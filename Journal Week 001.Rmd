### Introducing Myself

% Trial 

My name is **Preston Lyons** and I'm using ~~Github~~, sorry RStudio, to produce my first ever Journal entry. Though I don't have a Wikipedia page, you can find out about the city of [Preston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston,_Lancashire) in England, and [Lyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon)[^1] in France, in lieu of my name not *yet* being worth mentioning on Wikipedia.[^2] 

Another fact about myself is that I am doing research in the [Applied Developmental Psychology Lab](https://applieddevelopmentallab.com/) which works a lot with children, and a quote I quite like regarding children is that

> Even a minor event/ in the life of a child/ is an event of that child's world/ and thus a world event/

by Gaston Bachelard.[^3] 

I've included a list of the help received for this Journal, including a short summary of how they helped me:

1. Joseph Bulbulia, whose enthusiasm for statistics encouraged me
2. Johannes Karl, who showed me the ropes with downloading, using, and figuring out how to use:
- R
- RStudio
- Git
- Github
- GitKraken

[^1]: Note: again, for clarity, my name is Lyons, not Lyon.
[^2]: Also note: I am neither English, nor French
[^3]: I found a record of this quote [here](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/471937-even-a-minor-event-in-the-life-of-a-child)






BONUS: figure out how to add a bibliographic citation, such as [@darwin1964origin]
